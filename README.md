# Tools for unsupervised classification of acoustic signals
_DeepSS-unsupervised_ provides tools for pre-processing acoustic signals for unsupervised classification:

- extract waveforms or spectrograms of acoustic events from a recording
- normalize the duration, center frequency, amplitude, or sign of waveform/spectrograms

Unsupervised classification itself is performed using existing libraries:

- dimensionality reduction: [umap](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/)
- clustering: [hdbscan](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/) or [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)

Can be Used in combination with [DeepSS](https://github.com/janclemenslab/deepsongsegmenter), a deep learning based method for the supervised annotation of acoustic signals.


## Installation

```shell
pip install deepss-unsupervised
```

## Demos
 Illustration of the workflow and the method using vocalizations from:

- [flies](demo/flies.ipynb)
- [mice](demo/mice.ipynb)
- [birds](demo/birds.ipynb)
